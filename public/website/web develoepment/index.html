				My responsabilities in the company were to build, debug and add new features to their web app. Using technologies such as: React, R3F, JavaScript, Node.js, Three.js, GSAP, Cannon.js, Blender, Unity, Styled-Components ES6. One of the challanges of TitanSoft was that I had to connect their landing site for monitering to the R3F Virtual Reality app, I acomplish this by using my custom shaders, 3D models viewer and especially, a react library called "react-three-fiber".
